# Shopify Quick View  

Implemented a **Quick View** functionality in Shopify without using any apps. This feature is built using **custom JavaScript** and **Liquid schema** for seamless product previews.  

## Steps to Implement  

1. **Create a new JavaScript file** in the `assets` folder of your Shopify theme.  
2. **Add the required JavaScript code** to handle the Quick View functionality.  
3. **Modify `cart-product.liquid`** to include a Quick View button.  
4. **Add the Quick View button** to the product page.  
5. **Insert a container (div) in the theme** to display the Quick View content dynamically.
